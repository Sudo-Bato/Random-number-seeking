# Guess the Number Game (1-100) in JavaScript ðŸŽ¯

Hey everyone!  

I just finished building a simple **"Guess the Number"** game using **JavaScript**, where you have to guess a random number between 1 and 100. You have **10 attempts** to get it right, or you can quit anytime by entering **0**.

ðŸ”— **Hereâ€™s the link to play the game**: [Guess the Number Game](https://sudo-bato.github.io/Trouver-le-chiffre/)

### Features:
- **Guess**: Enter a number between 1 and 100.
- **Feedback**: Get hints if your guess is too high or too low.
- **Attempts**: You have 10 tries to guess the correct number.
- **Restart**: If you want to play again, just click restart!

Let me know what you think or if you have any ideas for improvements. Enjoy the game, and good luck! ðŸ˜„
